I am broadly interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in
ensuring that sophisticated AI systems will robustly and reliably carry out the
tasks that we want them to.

If you're a student at Stanford (undergraduate/masters/PhD) who wants to work on
a project involving safe and reliable machine learning: get in touch!

I studied Physics as an undergraduate at Cambridge University before switching
area to take a computer science master's degree. During my master's, it was a
pleasure to work with [Carl E. Rasmussen](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl),
developing variational methods for Gaussian Process State-Space Models.

Before starting my PhD at Stanford, I worked at the [Centre for Human
Compatible AI](http://humancompatible.ai), working with [Stuart
Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell) and [Daniel
Filan](http://danielfilan.com). I also worked at the Future of
Humanity Institute at Oxford University, collaborating with [Owain
Evans](https://owainevans.github.io) on scalable human supervision of
complex AI tasks.
