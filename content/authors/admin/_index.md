I am a Research Scientist at [FAR AI](https://far.ai), researching topics to reduce catastrophic risks 
from advanced AI systems. If you are doing similar work, please reach out -- I'd love to hear from you!
We are also [hiring](https://far.ai/jobs/).

I have a PhD from Stanford University, wonderfully advised by [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/). During my PhD, I studied a diverse range of topics including constrained reinforcement learning, variational inference, and autoregressive models. I studied Physics for my undergrad and took a Computer Science Master's. It was a pleasure to work with [Carl E. Rasmussen](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl), developing variational methods for Gaussian Process State-Space Models. I have also interned at the [Centre for Human Compatible AI](http://humancompatible.ai), the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, and DeepMind. A plaintext version of my resume is [here](/files/cv.md).
