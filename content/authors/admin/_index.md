I am a Research Scientist at [FAR AI](https://far.ai), researching topics to reduce catastrophic risks 
from advanced AI systems. If you are doing similar work, please reach out -- I'd love to hear from you!
We are also [hiring](https://far.ai/jobs/).

I have a PhD from Stanford University, wonderfully advised by [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/).
During my PhD, I studied a diverse range of topics including constrained reinforcement learning, variational inference,
and autoregressive models.

I studied Physics for my undergrad and took a Computer Science Master's. It was a
pleasure to work with [Carl E. Rasmussen](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl),
developing variational methods for Gaussian Process State-Space Models.

I have also interned at the [Centre for Human
Compatible AI](http://humancompatible.ai), the Future of
Humanity Institute at Oxford University, and DeepMind.
